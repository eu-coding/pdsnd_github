### Bikeshare Analysis in R

This project analyzes bikeshare data for New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago.

Note: the bikeshare file is in R, not Python, since I am completing this project from
the Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree Program.

### Files used
Files included in repository: bikeshare.R, README.md, .gitignore
(Files utilized in bikeshare.R analysis but not included in repository:
new-york-city.csv, washington.csv, chicago.csv)

### Credits
Repository template forked from Udacity: https://github.com/udacity/pdsnd_github.
